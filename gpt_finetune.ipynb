            " - I feel that the best compliment a man can give is not so much to his enemies as to his friends. He is much more dangerous to his friends than he is to himself.\n",
            "If you don't like the way you dress and the way your clothes smell, go down the rabbit hole of fashion.\n",
            "I think it's sad that the fashion world has become so skewed towards men. They have seen how women are going to turn on you when they think that fashion is about getting attention and not about being loved.\n",
            "I am a huge fashion fan and I love everything about the modern world. If I could make it more than one fashion, that probably would be it. But I would love to make it a global brand.\n",
            "I find it much more interesting than the things that make a fashion statement or a picture of my face - it's more like a kind of self-discipline.\n",
            "I was one of the girls in my generation that would go and do something that I would like to do. That's what I wanted to do, and I had a family. I didn't want to think about not being as famous. So in that respect I think I've made some big steps to get where I am.\n",
            "A little bit of fashion is more than what you think. A little bit of fashion is life.\n",
            "I love the people of fashion. I'm not one of them, and my taste, and my style, are not that influential and it's been difficult for me to maintain my cool.\n",
            "Some people think I am the biggest problem with fashion, in a sense, in my time. To be honest I have not noticed a lot of the progress I have made in my own country since World War II.\n",
            "A lot of fashion is based on love.\n",
            "I am a huge fan of the American style. The look on the outside is nothing but beautiful. I love clothes that I feel are cool. I don't like a man wearing a dress.\n",
            "I was the first girl, for girls, to go out into the world. They were really young and they were trying to make a career themselves but it was amazing because they grew up in a very special kind of world and this is what I was, I got accepted into college, and I really felt like I could do anything and do anything. And it was very hard for me.\n",
            "I think there are always some trends that you need to keep in check. You definitely need to look to the side of life in order to be in your best interest, and of course it is important to be part of your family and have a sense of humor and to make music. So there should be a bit of a challenge in order to be in your best interests. Also if you look at your family life, you can't really compare yourself to anybody in their current society. So the challenge is going to be what's the most important part of life and you can't really compare yourself to anybody else in your family.\n",
            "I always had a love of vintage clothing and it's sort of a way different than the real things. You can't get a great piece in vintage today. So for me it was like a fashion trend. I don't dress to fit in with people so it's not that I'm the only one in my family.\n",
            "And because I always remember that I grew up at the end of the 19th century, my style grew out of that. I had fashion that meant something, like a dress that said, 'I love fashion.'\n",
            "I like the music in my life.\n",
            "A lot of people's opinions about what is fashionable in the fashion world can be boiled down to one principle which must be followed: Don't look at fashion products as a problem.\n",
            "It's really sad that we have to go through the world of fashion all the time and have to make choices.\n",
            "At a time when women's rights are being used more and more, I feel really like the time has come to give women the moral right to define themselves to a higher level of excellence.\n",
            "I look at many other women and think, well, that looks like women to me, it looks like fashion. But I still feel like I have a better chance of having the 'look' of a fashionist.\n",
            "I've grown up not only in New York, but around the world.\n",
            "The fashion industry is so big, because of its size and the need for it. You look to the fashion world for inspiration and, you know, maybe have to give them a little support.\n",
            "But I think we need to think about our style, our style has to get a little bit more like a modern day and the fashion world is a modern day. That's what the American mainstream is.\n",
            "It's funny, because I used to wear a lot of fashion, but I always was in my 30s - I was in fashion for a long time - so I don't remember being in that period in your life, in school and life. Maybe you\n",

            "My favorite actress is Maisie Williams. If your daughter likes a guy who's strong and has a big heart, she'll take it. If you want to be a successful actress in the business, Maisie's got a heart and she wants to be someone special. I've gotten to know that just by being like her, she's attracted to me.\n",

            "I want to give back and I have been doing that for a while, but now I feel like it's more about finding that inner peace and finding the love of the real world.\n",
            "Well, it wasn't very flattering, and I have learned in the '80s that not everything - anything, not everything, is easy on people. And to me that's sort of the beauty of being famous. I don't know what that's like.\n",
            "The idea behind the show is that you spend two years in Paris. The next year the producers would return your notes. But then in 1989 the show took a really long time to get to its finish line.\n",
            "It was all of this fun with the other people I have with me, but it wasn't necessarily a great time to be rich and famous. It was a great time to be in love. And if I did, I'd probably be rich.\n",
            "I was always interested in fashion. It was a way to get money to enjoy things while you were famous. And it always had a positive side to it. It was always a way to keep up appearances.\n",
            "I have a huge reputation in the music business because I have seen so many beautiful women leave their careers because of the pressures to be famous, and everyone thinks they're brilliant or they're sexy.\n",
            "I think I've grown too much of a fan of the famous to go anywhere near being famous, but I've certainly had a huge influence on the younger generation.\n",
            "I've had the privilege of receiving lots of amazing and inspirational interviews with famous people who have come out of nothing but pure, pure love all these years and I have such a massive respect for what people are saying. I've been able to work with so many of them.\n",
            "I think it's one of the weird things about what we don't get to do is a lot of what we've already had for one reason or another. And I've never been famous myself because I've been trapped in a constant state of confusion about being a celebrity that I've met for a long time.\n",
            "When you're famous and it's the world that makes you famous, you want to be remembered, so maybe you've just earned that. But it's hard to really do the work the work is easier when you're famous and you don't feel like you've been recognized all the time.\n",
            "I have such a strong sense of humor and charm. I think it's amazing what you can achieve when you're famous, to have this ability in a way that makes people laugh or to have someone laugh or smile.\n",
            "I think that I still don't have that sense of wonder about myself, the way that I get the people who know and love me to want to be famous so they can see me in a bikini, that they want to see me in a sexy dress.\n",
            "I've gone through a lot, even going through that period of a celebrity. Growing up, nobody wanted to talk to me about how I had hit records or done anything that dramatic without the exposure.\n",
            "I love having a name in the tabloids, for instance, but I was a very famous TV star back in '66 and I was so busy.\n",
            "What made me famous? One thing is the age that I grew up, and then what made me famous was being a total freak.\n",
            "I'm fascinated by old people. When I go to the theater, I see the whole club. The younger generation is in the clubs. I see them in the movies, and it's an art of the ways. I've grown up with it.\n",
            "The American public are not the same people. They seem to be much better at expressing their feelings. I think being a successful American is a lot like being famous.\n",
            "I've just found that a major influence on me as a singer is doing my own personal impression. I used to play guitar. I think it just comes with working with bands that people are fascinated with. I was a musician for about four years - I'd been playing guitar for three years. I was in school, and I grew up.\n",
            "I remember, I was a little kid, and I always thought I was doing pretty good. So I never had any sense until I was in New York.\n",
            "Then I was really famous, so I came around as a kind of a kid. I was in an East Village high school. That's when I knew a bit about fashion - you don't feel comfortable without being famous, and that's why I knew I had one for a time. I wore it, but I had no clothes on.\n",
            "You know what happened in the '90s? When 'E!' became popular. I think what happened with 'E!' was a reaction to people who weren't as famous, and of course that's just the way it's always been. But then 'E' was like a big hit, and people were like, well, 'Dare\n",

            " to a friend. So I think, I just wanted to work.\n",
            "I never really knew what an artist was. I just kind of came to my knees about the fact that I was not going to be an artist. I've been doing stuff since I was about 14 at that time, and I knew what I was doing.\n",
            "I've gone on record writing music that's about my own experiences growing up. It's definitely been about music for the last five years. We are a band - I'll take it one way or the other.\n",
            "My friends call me 'the rapper of my dreams.' But I have three real brothers and a boyfriend. I have a cousin who's been doing rap-y stuff for a few years now. He's actually a rapper himself. So I don't think any rap star would want to work with me. The reality is he's so lucky.\n",
            "I'm a very, very musical person. I think I'm the only one who can play a tune. My music doesn't change.\n",
            "I think a lot of artists are afraid to release their music until it's commercialized. It really is. I don't know how it's that it's not commercial, but I'm afraid to be the one to sell me a record, because I'm so afraid to release the record.\n",
            "Music has given me the means to express feelings.\n",
            "My music hasn't changed. I didn't grow up listening to my father. I still like to hear other musicians tell stories and make up melodies that we didn't hear and that's my style, too.\n",
            "The problem is that the '60s were just one-time releases of all-time material. The '90s are like, what happened to us? We were out of albums. We were out of records.\n",
            "I'm the sort of musician who doesn't get fired one week and then the next week and the next ten days. That's the reality, because I've always been known as something of a perfectionist. I never want to be the guy who doesn't have enough records.\n",
            "I have no choice but to give thanks to those who keep this great America moving forward, whether it is the music or the streets or the flag. I don't have to sit around at the mercy of rap music or any of it it's not going away.\n",
            "It's amazing how far you can travel. But to still be in music is incredible. I have to keep putting those kids through that.\n",
            "It is with so many of my songs that I come to the conclusion that if I were to leave music forever, I would have to take up some new ground. That's not a good place to be at all... The idea of leaving has nothing to do with everything that I love as a person, and everything that people have been passionate about.\n",
            "I want to be remembered as a songwriter that makes music that is timeless and timeless.\n",
            "If one is to be true to himself and to be what one loves, to remain faithful in others' paths, as a tree which is the head of that family which loves its own life, and whose beauty imitates that of its neighbors, then music is all that remains to me.\n",
            "I love food and food is a great motivator. I think that's more a reflection of what my parents and my life are than my music.\n",
            "When I hear good music, I'm always attracted to certain things. I want to listen to the soul and the songs.\n",
            "I've taken the opportunity of working on my own since high school to try and make music as an independent artist rather than as a member of a mainstream label or producer.\n",
            "I really didn't think it was so much cool to be me back then, but I am definitely feeling it now. I think people are starting to see me in my new and more authentic voice - someone who has a really rich and exciting past that I'm coming back to.\n",
            "I'm trying to make music that is timeless, that celebrates a life and soul, and that makes you feel beautiful, safe, happy and healthy.\n",
            "My music is about the life of a child who is trying to become the best he can be.\n",
            "Music made up of the sounds of sound, with the same quality and consistency which are identical in their musical formula, can be at once beautiful and tragic.\n",
            "I didn't have all the talent or the vision that I would have had if I had been successful or if I were a singer. I was blessed enough to have a family and mentors who believed in me and who were there for me every step of the way.\n",
            "The thing that has kept most of my fans in a constant state of apathy and horror is the fact that I have a very clear vision of what I was capable of as a singer.\n",
            "When you get that talent, you have to leave and find something else. I was a teacher and singer, so there were times when I just didn't know what I was doing.\n",
            "I\n",

            "I mean, if you're into fashion, you'd be amazed at how much money you save by buying clothes or buying jewelry.\n",
            "My favorite dress is probably the tulle and the green cardigan.\n",
            "The hardest thing on my body is putting on the outfit. That's the kind of thing that you have to do in a fashion show.\n",
            "I just went out for a swim in the pool. It's such an adrenaline rush, it's such a pleasure to swim right there all day. I get out there and I do what I feel like I'm supposed to do. I just don't have the time.\n",
            "The hardest thing on my body is putting on the outfit.\n",
            "There is nothing more amazing than the discovery of a new beauty at seven years old and that beauty is always good. I am in a constant state of meditation and have a tendency with my body to startle when I look at myself in the mirror.\n",
            "Beauty is not to be avoided that should alone exist, as we know, only for a moment, Beauty would be a dreadful Goddess.\n",
            "I was a kid growing up, so it was really hard to escape from my life. I went to ballet as well as the clubs, and I loved it. Then in the late 1970s, I started doing this crazy dance thing. It was crazy crazy.\n",
            "Every girl I know should have a little bit of courage, and that's the beauty of being a beauty pageant queen. A lot of women look amazing, and some look amazing, but they never look great. I know, I know, I know.\n",
            "I got a wonderful little book in the back of my closet, and it teaches me how to be a woman. And you can be a woman of color if you so choose. For me, a beauty book is a book of love.\n",
            "Most of all, I'm not a great believer in the supernatural, and I don't think there's a place there for supernatural in any sort of modernity, in which the idea of God was at the core of a lot of popular culture.\n",
            "For me, life was about discovering myself. I was always in pursuit of what I wanted to do, not necessarily a career in fashion or fashion design. I also grew up watching television and writing my own stories in Latin.\n",
            "We love being able to be friends. It's the easiest thing in the world to keep a friendship open. I always wanted to do more. I just wanted to be around people more. It's a great way to keep your friendship going.\n",
            "My whole life, I've had a very close relationship with my mom, and she's gotten me to have friendships that I could never do. She's a real help, and I'm a total person. I know a million things every day. It's amazing to have the support of someone like that.\n",
            "What makes a good girlfriend is the fact that you don't have to think about her every day. She's not going anywhere. It's a combination of the two that makes a good girlfriend. I mean, she's in a relationship and you spend most of your time with her, you don't need to deal with her every day. She's got the potential to do an amazing job on your behalf.\n",
            "When I first started to write 'Morning Glory,' I would be on the plane from LAX to Dallas, and I would make all the stops over, and the women would join me and I would sit around the back of the plane and I would just talk and go, 'Morning Glory,' and I would say a lot of strange things about the women I was with.\n",
            "When I started the show in 1987, there were 11 women in me. By the summer of 1990, there were only four. I never got a chance to do 'Morning Glory' on my own.\n",
            "I just want to get back to a regular job and do some TV. My kids are excited about that. I want to be a mom and have a normal life. They really need that and I just want them to have that. I don't know though it is too late in me to get a nice job.\n",

            "This show gets me back into a lot - which I find really interesting because I really feel that there is a deep, lasting energy in American culture. And I don't think that people are getting any younger. I think a lot of the writing's going on and it's getting a little more old, and perhaps I'm just waiting a little longer for the chance to get into the material.\n",

            " hope. I love to write, so I have to keep writing and hope the world keeps reading.\n",
            "That's my goal, my message - that I can never tell you. You see, what I'm offering - if you listen - I can make you feel great life and hope.\n",
            "I think the most important thing for anybody is to believe in what God does for you, and be open to what God has told you. Otherwise, if we're not open to what God has told us, it's not possible to share the gospel, and hope, and learn, and live.\n",
            "The real issue is not whether we have the most faith or not, but whether belief in the divine will can happen at any time.\n",
            "The United States is not part of the E.U. I'm not trying to come to your knees with the whole Church. There's always the United Nations and I'm not trying to come to your knees with the whole Church. The E.U. is about faith and hope and democracy, and I think it's about that. I think it's about faith, and I think it's about living our lives in a hopeful way.\n",
            "I think there is now, as of today, more than 200 million people without internet access. Much more people without Internet than without it. And the problem is a growing body of research that suggests that the lack of broadband has negative health impacts on people's lives and that this can have serious consequences.\n",
            "I have made some big mistakes. I'm still learning and a lot of my mistakes have led to a lot of huge opportunities now or potential. I hope people will find the mistakes themselves.\n",
            "The truth is that I have a whole world of possibilities, a whole world of hope and faith that can lift me in many ways.\n",
            "One of the things that I tried to do in my life has been to just pray and think about the future. I can't do it without thinking about the past and being inspired to find new ways for things to happen again, and hope for a bright future for the people of this land.\n",
            "I hope America, with or without Libya, is a continent of great memory, a continent of hope and a continent of hope.\n",
            "I hope there is a bright future for our state because my campaign is working.\n",
            "So if you're a kid or a senior wondering if your education could make a difference, go ahead, enroll in college. As I get older, I hope you become more diligent about reading, writing, being responsible and honest about how you want to spend your time.\n",
            "The problem is that we seem to have lost sight of the basic principle of the 21st Century economy - that an economy based on the power of small business, centered around growth and consumption, can lift everyone, but based on small business taxes, small business regulations, and an ideology of competition and individual initiative.\n",
            "As a father and a mother who was a member of the Congress for women, I can tell you that I have the deepest respect for women having the choice between being a part of a man's world or being his world. I want them to succeed.\n",
            "Sometimes it's very scary. I mean, some girls are really sexy and some guys are just plain boring. But this world of hope and possibilities gives you a lot of hope and confidence if you really make the effort.\n",
            "The thing about the young woman who never gets off the ground is that she has to face the fact that she can't control herself, and even sometimes, even if she manages to stay on the ground, she'll run away and get upset and run right back out. And all the time, she's been doing this to herself by putting her feet up on the ground and rubbing some dirt off her foot.\n",
            "I pray every day to stop the exploitation of my body. I hope to get justice done.\n",
            "If you think that marriage is just between a man and a woman and if you think that gay marriage should be between a man and a woman, don't spend your life in that situation. It's too painful for your feelings.\n",
            "I had many things going on in my life: my career, the family, my family. Some of my best moments were at home. But the biggest one was moving into a relationship that was definitely a lot more comfortable than a normal one. But you know what I realized that's when I began trying to bring an end to the relationship that everything was going so badly for me and I wasn't able to make a positive living here at home. You just didn't believe it, didn't pay attention.\n",
            "I have my work cut out for me, the most serious thing. There is nothing I want more than to be here now, have more love interests to fill the gap left by what's happened to me, more hope and more hope for a better life to come.\n",
            "All my life, I've wanted to write. I'm a writer who thinks about things - but I don't, I can't write for people.\n",

            "My father was a big fan of The Beatles and had a feeling I was going to get all of the Beatles out of him, but I told him it was too late. He insisted on my reunion, though, because he knew something was missing.\n",
            "In my dad's world, he used to go to work in the evening to get some light sleep. I grew up with my dad, but as my dad and a dad, I was the most relaxed person you can imagine. It was a way of giving back, and I think it was something deeper than just being the son of an older woman.\n",
            "Mitch used to be my dad and I still go along with him.\n",
            "Sometimes the sadness of my dad was what I needed it to be.\n",
            "I was a huge fan of the TV show My Country. My dad used to get me scripts, the scripts were never done, and then one of them came out and he had a big pile of stuff written and he wanted me to play it, so we'd play it in the back room, and then you'd take your scripts from back when I was a baby. I loved that - there was nothing like it.\n",

            "I love my grandmother. She was a mother and a scholar. Our family has been extremely close, and that's something you want to build up and grow into. I've been able to do that, which has been my real blessing, has been something I'm really looking forward to.\n",
            "It was my dad who told me that he was a frustrated music fan and a frustrated father, and I was a bit like him in that I hated to end things because that was my path to freedom. So I think that sort of led me to the idea of doing what I could, but at the same time, have a sense of something worthwhile. Having a good relationship.\n",

            "You know, I've been very lucky for my friends, and I know there are a lot of auteur directors that I want to work with, and maybe there are people on The Golden Girls that I really want to work with. It's just another small group of wonderful actors that I've been in movies with for a long time. But we're gonna work with people again!\n",
            "I'm gonna be a real strong believer in equality, inclusiveness and diversity in every department of our lives.\n",
            "I hope to make an album when I'm 50 years old - and I hope it's not a box-office bomb.\n",
            "I'm gonna work out and then I'm gonna get home at 5 am and wake up and find my wife has sent me a stack of papers trying to find the work.\n",
            "But I do believe that the more we learn about animals, the more we realize that when you kill a lion or a chicken or a kangaroo you mean no harm. But then we don't kill animals for our own good. And we don't allow a lion to become a kangaroo.\n",
            "It's an ongoing fight, but I try to work in a funny way.\n",
            "We are all at times the victim of tragedy, sometimes in our work, and we sometimes in ourselves.\n",
            "If the United States is to have a moral culture, it must not glorify the destruction of animals it must glorify our pain.\n",
            "You must have people around you who can work. When you're in pain, focus and try to find someone who can calm you down. Because if you lose track of some deep, primal need, you don't have that alone.\n",
            "When you think about it, when you have no control over your work, the only thing you do is call somebody else, whether it's mom or dad or a doctor, an accountant, or any of those crazy folks that make up the government.\n",
            "In a lot of ways I've always had an ambivalent attitude toward the cinema. As a kid, I'd come home to two or three desks, and it would be an onslaught of scripts, and I'd go to all the movies and check them out. I think there's something inherently exploitative about it.\n",
            "The biggest cause of grief in the U.S.S.R. is the loss of faith in the work of others. That's a pain in the bum sense - it means you're no longer in the 'Harmony' who deserve 'We Are the Forces of Progress' - but it certainly is a big one indeed.\n",
            "I'm not an actor, so I can work and not think about my work.\n",
            "I don't play with my boyfriends and my boyfriends don't play with my boyfriends.\n",
            "Most of the people my age are trying to find their own identity. What I am doing, and who I am, and where I come from, for now is part of my identity as an artist. I hope someone will find their own way or feel I can work.\n",
            "There is little difference in people. If I have the courage to work and the humility to accept, I am going to do it.\n",
            "Being a mother is not a job. Being a mom is an incredible job. But the fact is, my children come first. As their parents, our jobs will be even more important than the children's jobs they provide.\n",
            "That is why I wanted to travel around the world in collaboration with filmmakers and artists, who are trying to help raise funds for the Small Business Administration, to learn more about issues important to small businesses. We hope to engage filmmakers via conferences, putting together panels and tweeting when they reach out to me.\n",
            "It's the most incredible job I've ever had to take part in, because obviously I get to travel around Europe and I get to travel to France and we're getting to play music together with them!\n",
            "The greatest thing you can do as someone who works on a book and an artist is be able to show your artwork to somebody. Because I've been completely through it, I need to have them see it as an adult.\n",
            "What's amazing about the number of artists that share their work and who are still producing, is the sheer number of people. There are so many people who share it, sharing the same vision of what they want to do. As artists, we're more than willing to collaborate on anything.\n",
            "I was so surprised at how much fun I had to have making videos. It's amazing to make videos. I love YouTube, but I think YouTube is something that maybe isn't very compelling, and that I can have the opportunity to use.\n",
            "It really was an amazing honor to work with David S. Goyer and give this incredible performance of my own.\n",
            "I think people have to take a lot of satisfaction from the work that I do on their own. And I've always said there isn't that great a chance if you do things and share them. I mean\n",

            "A lot of actors that I can't go out on the street and talk to people for 10 or 15 years, so I'm in that kind of space with my work. But my work as an actor, I'm very interested in that kind of thing, my relationships with people. The relationship of the human soul, you know.\n",
            "I never had an actor friend. I was very comfortable. I knew when people were going to get audited or gotten to work that I didn't get audited and I was there for them. And I still believe I did that.\n",
            "And I think all of our artists - even the ones that aren't ourselves artists - are kind of enamored with actors. Some are better than other. But there's this thing that everyone agrees on - that you always want to be an actor, as everybody says you should be.\n",
            "My main career goal is to make music again. I hope to keep doing that, in the time allotted for it.\n",
            "Music should be used as your background and as your instrument when you're in a good mood and aren't thinking too much.\n",
            "I think music is more important than movies.\n",
            "I think a lot of what I listen to is just to pay the bills. I like to listen to NPR, you know, which is a pretty good source. And then there are a lot of other things, like my favorite poets of my time that I don't like. I just think they are interesting and interesting.\n",
            "I was very close to Bruce Springsteen. Springsteen is one of my favorite acts. So when they played at my school, I was there, and the next thing I know, I'm playing their show, and that's the feeling.\n",
            "People need to understand that, with so many different things happening at once, you can't work in one place. And so people don't always have the patience or ability to understand what's going on. You have to use whichever tools you have. I think this is why so many actors get into the business and aren't ready to leave.\n",
            "But I don't think you ever know how long it'll last, because the world doesn't really change when it's the actors that you know, that you know, and they don't play the role. It's very different.\n",

            "My writing has to get pushed through. You have to try to make your writing more than just the physical world. And that can be a little daunting at times. But I'm just glad it's a part of my life and it's more than I ever thought.\n",

            "I'm still a little doubtful about the relevance of 'I Love Lucy' to me. I think Lucy is such a great song, sung by a pretty girl who's just got a pretty heart and a pretty soul. But the fact that I wrote it for myself is something I'd rather not dwell on. But I think it's pretty amazing that I got the song.\n",
            "In the 'Harry Potter' universe, a magical girl is the only one, ever, who has magic powers and an important job. When Harry Potter returns, all will be said to the 'Luna' to mark the occasion. Is it a coincidence that Luna is the same role, but a full 43 years after Harry Potter's birth, and just 21 years after our final meeting?\n",
            "The question of whether women can be trusted to care about basic stuff, such as education or jobs - or to protect them from what they cannot do, such as the care of the family, or putting an end to the spread of disease - is one that will determine whether our politics are dominated by either a conservative core or by something else entirely.\n",

            "A country must start with a message, a desire, a vision and a plan which the people can reach far and near to form a personal, durable, secure, and enduring security... Even if they cannot deliver that message or plan they must at some time reach for it and get it done.\n",
            "I'm not afraid of aging, of having no career, or of anything like that because I know how to take it away. I don't have to fear death. I'm only scared of death.\n",
            "A few good friends gave birth to beautiful daughters and women and married them up before the old times were over. It was a disgrace.\n",

There is not a sound in my heart, not a voice that has been whispered, or a voice that has broken through the silence that has been given to us all.

            "From the time I first began covering events in the communist country, from the time as a reporter until I was handed the camera and an encouragement by the KGB, I managed to meet people and find my way. Along with my good friends in the United States, I hope to England one day.\n",

            "I've always taken my ups and downs way more, because my experience is mostly based on what people say around me when I'm not screaming in my face.\n",
            "I have always said it's the best thing that ever happened to me, that I could ever learn about, let alone explain, was watching my father, Bob Hope Armstrong, with his blazing spirit. That was one of the biggest lessons he was ever learning. Be good. Don't let your ego get in the way of your experience.\n",
            "I was lucky enough to be brought up in a very open home, where there was a lot of possibility of experience. But like everyone, it's different for different people.\n",

            "If we wish history accurately, we must first establish that all men are endowed by their nature largely with limited powers of doing and of reasoning largely contrary to each other.\n",
            "It seems a bit bizarre that a novelist should have no experience at all but a kind of literary slave labour.\n",

            "When you come into the business and you have an understanding of your business and your relationship to it - all of those things - you will find that one of two very valid points are often very close. The first is that you will find satisfaction in the relationship, the second is that you will learn more useful than you ever thought.\n",

It's not like I'm sitting there at a desk and somebody's trying to force me to do some pretty dumb things. But, it's certainly a higher level in my soul than some of the stereotypes I've encountered in my life.\n",

            "In America, we have a different culture - a different way of dealing with things - and a more open culture which is less afraid to be controversial.\n",
            "I do some theater, but I think it must be a safe haven and refuge of the macabre when it comes to scary movie stories.\n",
            "I like to travel, but I am an amateur traveler.\n",
            "In New York, I also travel and see the city. The old buildings are gone and I see the city and feel the freedom of the place.\n",
            "I always travel with a backpack and a smile.\n",
            "My mom's a pretty sweet lady. I travel with my older brother and sister and so she always pushes me, whether it's travel or anything else. When I was younger I felt like a freak. But I'm not as freak-worthy as I used to be then. I travel with the intention of making things better and make them better.\n",
            "My first year of high school was rough. I was in a band and I got cut, and my second year was when I started to get money and I was taken off the street and bullied at school. At the time, I wasn't critical, I was supportive. I told my teachers that I wanted to go on track and wanted to adjust my goals accordingly.\n",
            "Travel is insanity for a day.\n",
            "And I was the first guy to go to the moon. And if I'd been picked at random I don't know how I would have performed. I could have gone flying or sitting and listening to classical music. It's a total outlet. I've already jetvelled many, many times and am now getting to drive myself to the British cities.\n",
            "But I think it's a mistake to ever underestimate how big a toll gangster travel can have on our national psyche.\n",
            "I would travel with a man and have dinner. That would be really, really useful.\n",
            "Travel and education are the one indispensable articles of end, and science the most interesting to pursue.\n",
            "Some folks are always going on the 10, going 30, going 100 yards, going from point A to point B. They go about 2 miles at night, then they go back to their hotel, and they are all the time. I travel so often that I am plagued with insomnia.\n",
            "I'm at the point where I don't even have time to live anymore. I have all my relatives at this stage of their lives. It's too late by all means travel and feed them. They have enough to do as they please.\n",
            "There is no travel necessary to the betterment of mankind.\n",
            "Travel in small bands, yes. But today the idea of exploration and sharing a common thread is deadlier than the freight carried by it. There must be more railroads going around every day!\n",
            "The average female receives more attention than any other young person. Yet, we spend far more time bonding than bonding, for that is just how things are for girls, you know.\n",
            "The whole travel thing is one of those things that you hear a lot in Hollywood, where maybe you could be such an actor if you didn't do too bad for too many years. I think it's true, and it's really bad for a lot of people. Especially musicians because they can't play their own self-created form, even with travel.\n",

            "But the man of genius travels the world and knows nothing of his own country. He stops at a town or village and then writes his experiences there for others to enjoy. He continues his travels, not as a teacher, so far as I know.\n",
            "One of the big attractions of travel is the feeling - of seeing and smelling and looking at beautiful flowers. There is nothing like seeing eggs in the finest form, light, air, and color. It defies description!\n",
            "I'm just traveling and I travel by train and I just can't find the small town that's going by me. When I do find it I just travel by disappointment. That's it.\n",
            "The traveler thinks he sees country he hears country, but he sees no country he hears no country, but he sees much, but he speaks much he speaks is no mirage.\n",
            "My father used to drive me to all the wrong places. He'd be sitting at home and I'd be a raving maniac, I'd go 80 miles an hour, I'm the type of guy who doesn't get around. I get tired. So I just set up shop in the hamlet of Siena.\n",

            " work of religion, is not always a perfect activity, you have to work hard at it to be true.\n",
            "We don't believe religion means anything to me.\n",
            "To my mind, the worst way to express the non-existence of God is to suggest to him, through religion, that he may exist (though he cannot exist for very long).\n",
            "I have a deep respect for traditional religion.\n",
            "It is important to recognize and religion in the public square, whatever the beliefs that people hold, are important.\n",
            "One does not seek divine punishment for one's religion, one must not seek it.\n",
            "In the long run all religions seem to be worse than Christianity, because they are the more repulsive, the less stimulating.\n",
            "I am just an atheist. I believe in God, but I believe in people's irrationality about it. Those people are irrational.\n",
            "Atheism is a science founded on the belief that a good man is better than a bad one.\n",
            "There are two things that every man - a friend - and a religion - the human species and its capacity for self-sacrifice.\n",
            "I think a world without Christians would be a kind of a death camp. You're a child of the modern age. You're a child of the past. Every word that's ever said is for art.\n",
            "Religion, like politics, is based on the clash and fighting between moral and ethical instincts. Politics is based on the challenge of the good to fight it and its resulting replacement by competing selfish politics.\n",
            "What one should do, if one desires, is to find another avenue of achieving virtue and virtue aim for one's own purpose. And the same way the same way the same way the same way - just like the same way the same way - religion can help us reach for our own God.\n",
            "Not only is religion not for its members - coal miners - but they are not only those who practise the religion they practise. They are those who practise it without knowing whether they practise it or not.\n",
            "This is not a political issue - this is a philosophical question. Do we want a democratic government in England and a secular one? The religious right can answer that question, but only after a process of philosophical reflection, research, debate and investigation.\n",
            "God, my religion, and the British government are three men in one, that's enough.\n",
            "All the religions that I practice I know. I'm afraid of the world, the world without governments. It's just a very confusing place, filled with contradictions, ambiguities, presuppositions, presuppositions. You could say I'm a revolutionary without grasping that religion is also considered revolutionary? I would quite rightly reply that so is atheism.\n",
            "We live in a time in which we ask what's in the religion. Once we're in that moment, our whole lives change. We can be in that moment, have our entire lives now because it's the right moment.\n",
            "There are certain people who seek to take everything and throw it in a good category, and replace it with the symbol of what the gods offer. That's the trouble with advertising - it's a game. If you run a good advertising agency you always hope for the worst. The odds are against you, they are against you, and you can't hope to change their attitude.\n",
            "They have called me the religion of hope. This is a good name for myself, because I want people to call me hope.\n",
            "The best medicine is never heard of who has not dispensed it, unless he had it himself. Man is a god, to whom nothing is more precious than life. He is the only force capable of effective effectual giving and living beings are like him. The sick are his god and I believe him to be so.\n",
            "My religion is sort of based on the equation, 'If I believe in Santa Claus I believe in the Coca-Cola Company.'\n",
            "I'm not religious, but I have no problem with being true to myself and being reasonable and rational and not collapsing around religious arguments.\n",
            "I believe in a religion, but I am not comfortable being a part of pop culture right now.\n",
            "The message that we get from this election is that politics is a game, and everyone has a role, that everyone has a right to be heard, that everyone has a right to be left alone. And no one's doing anything particularly well in politics, frankly, solely because of who they are.\n",
            "No one can claim to have all the answers, but every question has been put there to give it answers - and let's not forget that every answer comes there with strings attached.\n",
            "If we look at the Bible, we find all of the books of Moses, Abraham, Abraham, and Solomon all by one stanza. Where does the Bible get the most information, stuff to make it interesting? Where do all these stories take place? Who controls all these people control that universe.\n",
            "I get very frustrated with people who say they don't like certain things about me. They\n",

And the fact that the same questions somehow are getting the same questions in the same way every time, you are telling me the truth.\n",

            "Learning how to be modest in pursuit of learning did not always go hand-in-hand with real success.\n",
            "I think success is a wonderful journey, and I've seen it ultimately be a blessing in disguise. The important thing is that the journey does not interfere with the quest for the truth.\n",
            "The secret of my success is actually not wanting to be famous, but just being myself. I never seek out famous people to make money. I just like the few people that are alive and getting the notoriety that I do.\n",
            "The thing about black America is, I had so many women over 50, who I admired and liked and wanted to please, who were my main sources of success. When you lose that, you just know it was the Black Friday of the financial crisis.\n",
            "Being a successful author means having lots of cash to give to the publishing house or company to make it profit. For a writer this means constant writing for success and financial security. Success is not just in the money page.\n",

            "I'm not sure it takes me as much success as I want. After all, I'm not trying to wake up every single person in the world up in a big fat belly to say I'm amazing. I'm not.\n",
            "We don't make decisions based on success.\n",
            "I'm not saying I didn't put real work in my life that I would benefit from it because I have absolutely nothing to prove! But of course, with success, you always have to sacrifice. And you always have to be very honest with yourself. Because otherwise you don't know what's going to happen.\n",
            "I think, in almost all cases, success depends on physiological responses to stress response throughout the day action curves to determine physiological responses to resistance exercise and then to the next set of responses.\n",

            "In New Orleans, everyone is on the plane. You call the steward and he'll say, 'You know, it's great to see you, but it's not a success to know that you've become less popular than you thought.' People will go in and say, 'You know, it's great. The bugs are out of the way. The trouble is over.'\n",
            "What's really important is that, when audiences have a difficult time overcoming it, that audiences stop being opposed to the show because they've had a difficult time overcoming it, or they admire it because we've had a difficult time overcoming it.\n",
            "With the success of the last three years, there seems to be a lot more time to look at next year, where we likely focus. Hopefully we're going to spend quite a bit more time focusing on the Beauty and the Beast.\n",
            "People in power seek to confuse the West with the East, to point guns at the crowd in the hope that our people will somehow resist being shot. In fact, as much as we respect freedom of speech and freedom of the press, we are afraid to say it. And as much as we wonder if this is a coincidence, it is.\n",

The second responsibility is to society as a whole, as owner. That is his job, to the individual. That is his responsibility.\n",
            "The biggest difficulty in education is that the very best minds are not usually very clever.\n",
            "I have a pretty terrible sense of humor. At first I kind of struggled with it. I'd only seen two other people on television on this sense of humor level.\n",
            "And I am not just talking about advertising, but have a sense of wacky sense of humor and it is totally gone off the bridge.\n",
            "Our country's political scene has become out of step with the social concerns of today's world by attempting to reconcile diversity with gender, race and age.\n",
            "I've always taken a zero-effort, zero-amend attitude. I mean, no matter how much money you get, no matter how much time you spend with somebody, no matter how big or how young they appear to be, no matter how smart or energetic they appear to be, no matter how smart or energetic they appear to be.\n",
            "This is the America that I love. The America that dared not to fail. The America that chose failure as a guide. The America that asked no questions and stood by its naught.\n",

            "I can't say enough about how skillful and original Sarah is as a front line. We have a lot of skill at her back line. It depends on the movie. Does she have a clear line that she can't cross?\n",
            "My mom used to sing me the original 'I Know You Care,' 'It's a Wonderful Life' and 'Let's Go To Washington' at my concerts. I've listened to those because I think they're healing songs.\n",
            "I wanted to try my hand at acting. My mom was one of 14 kids and I was the youngest, and she had to be able to trust me. So I just did what I could, went to work.\n",
            "My mom was a public school teacher, and she had a library full of books and my dad had books in the library. So I worked with him, and that was a very nurturing environment for me. I worked hard.\n",
            "My mom had a beautiful 3D drawing that she gave me, and she told me how much I wanted to be a movie star by the time I was 5 years old.\n",
            "We had a very close bond. My mom and dad are so much fun memories.\n",
            "I don't think being a stay-at-home mom is the most important thing for a woman. At least for a girl like mine, I don't think I'm going to have the luxury of loving me more than I can realistically hope for.\n",
            "I'm not a big movie star. I'm not in the slam-dunk stage of Hollywood. My mom's a different person.\n",
            "My mom's got some great theater tapes in her car. I can't access the garbage.\n",
            "My mom and my dad got divorced when I was young - we didn't have a family.\n",
            "I love being a mom, and I love being a wife.\n",
            "I am a strong believer that we protect the environment, whether we are growing a garden or starting a small business. Our ancestors planted a garden every day - if they needed a grow-in, we were able to. I believe in the right policies and an for-profit industry that can help us ensure it is a 'first come, first served' situation.\n",
            "When I came to New York, my ambition then was to become an actor or director or writer to name but a few. I decided it was time to leave this occupation, full time, and get doing work I had been thankful for, as well as learn a new language and new customs.\n",
            "I had really bad buckur (drowned plants). I thought, 'What is going to happen to this?'\n",
            "It's not so much that you don't have a hard time learning German, but that you actually learn it in half a dozen different ways.\n",
            "I'm an English teacher, and I'm a former Pretty Little Liars and Batman and other people play their cards. It's a whole learning process. I didn't know that beforehand. Every week I'd spend some time trying to figure out what did and didn't work out. Which is a constant process.\n",
            "When I was a child I didn't have a lot of friends, and when I was a teenager I didn't have a lot of friends I'd never had. But my mother always encouraged us to find friends. Friends are amazing, it's what keeps us special.\n",
            "I can make a good movie star out of hang all around. My dad taught me that.\n",
            "My family's background was straight up from the musicals of the '20's and ' 30 Rock. If I was singing, I was skipping class. So it was about the same musicals we had, and my mom and dad were both from Chicago, so I came from a working-class background.\n",
            "I love studying my music.\n",
            "My family and friends think I've inherited some of the lessons learned from my mom.\n",
            "The only thing I can do is always go shopping, walk the floor, buy new bodies of the same quality. I am obsessed with finding perfect material, so naturally I have a continual search and search for perfecting the body of the body we all adorn.\n",
            "When we have a financial need, we buy. We call it 'theis shopping.'\n",
            "I am really trying to put together an energy now as myself, very purely an entertainer. I always go to Leonard, was in Parliament when I was a kid, and my mom was at every soccer game, and my dad played jazz.\n",
            "When I hear my mom speak there is hope for the future, I know that is true.\n",
            "I was raised with so many of the same values as my dad: love, love, love, but also hope, faith, honesty, compassion and laughter.\n",
            "I'm actually not a believer that you can have as much hope as you desire.\n",
            "Every time I think I'm heading in the wrong direction, that motivates me even more. Hope is the best thing that's happened to me\n",

            "They do not understand that if you have to defend yourself on several separate occasions in order to win, you must be fatigued and on various different days during the whole of the competition as well as the long periods at the end of the year.\n",
            "I don't want to see fast-food restaurants in Chicago. It's so ugly. It reminds me of when I was riding in the Coney Island water with my dad just wantin' to talk to him, like... no, I don't want to ruin that feeling.\n",
            "The greatest tragedy in mankind's whole history may be the hijacking of morality by religion.\n",
            "You know, my daddy was a man. You know, people don't think the government's for kings and queens and all that stuff.\n",
            "My father's love had a way of making me see another set of eyes, a more positive life. I saw a lot of things the hard way. My father being thrown out of the church twice, being moved away from my family.\n",
            "I am a redneck. My dad taught rug weaving.\n",
            "My dad taught us to do simple things in a way to make the dreams of a kid-loving citizen who didn't have a business degree become a financial driver come one day.\n",
            "I want to stay unemployed as my career takes me beyond my best effort to downtown. I hate that.\n",
            "I think that people should have as great a responsibility as they can have, to take care of their family, as well as their kids. Because if they don't have a family, well, someone needs to take care of them. And there are going to be a few who want to complain all the time.\n",
            "My favorite thing is my Dad to show for it: Every night, he offers prayers for me.\n",
            "I like to do things by my own script, which keeps things simple and gives me room to grow. But in a very simple country, I'm only focusing on the story and the music. Sometimes I end up wishing that all the different cast and crew had all the time in the world to make this the perfect story, music piece.\n",
            "If you have a good father and a great mom, everybody is easier to work with.\n",
            "My dad and mom believed in me.\n",
            "The thing I was trying to get over as a kid, and this is the difference between my sister, Miles Tice, is that she's a total action star. She's been in movies like Star Trek and she's an actress in those movies at some point in her life.\n",
            "It feels good to have your work considered other people's work.\n",
            "My dad died when I was 3 years old and my mother gave him his first book.\n",
            "My dad has a tendency to stay up late at parties, and my parents had an argument and I'm not even talking about the party, which had to do with politics.\n",
            "One of the biggest titles that I've ever owned is Rolling Stone, they're the most influential rock magazine in the world. They're like my No. 1 book growing up, rock history, magazine, and influence.\n",
            "All of a sudden it all came together at 16, this big marriage. I knew I was going to do something that was more personal. I had a life situation with my mom that I wasn't ashamed to say was my dad's.\n",
            "I'm not a defender of the juvenile justice system I feel very strongly for all the needless deaths and injuries caused by the age- of-of-12. Of all the alternatives, I don't think it's any less true that it is an issue to more kids than I do because most of them don't face the consequences of their mistakes age one by one.\n",
            "My mom is really, really strong. I'm not a defender of the juvenile justice system. I'm not a defender of the family detention center, I'm not a defender of anybody just making the world safe for children. I'm not defending any of that... my life's work.\n",
            "The hardest thing probably growing up in the Mormon church is the structure, which is very unclear to a younger generation. To which I am grateful, and which now appears to be a struggle one couldishly overcome with hostility and ridicule.\n",
            "You go through life wondering what is the most important thing and what's most important to you at any point in life. I say the things I believe in, not the things I prefer to do without wondering.\n",
            "When I was younger, I would go out with my friends because we were just taking our skateboarding pleasure and skateboarding and friends, and growing up. I think adolescence is such a great time for skating. It really becomes more of a freedom-of-expression, a chance for me to experience the world, skate for me to skate.\n",

            "For the past five years, we've been trying to make sense of the Republican threat, and maybe it's time to look at the Democratic threat, too. But for now, we should be focusing on what is appealing to younger voters. And, it's true, Bush has had a big lead in the popular vote since 2004. But that same kind of devil can exist in both the private and public sector.\n",

            "The secret of a successful marriage is not to be boring, but to strike the right balance between the exciting parts of your life, your intimate parts. Take moments off and think about what you want to do. Last a little while, yes please.\n",

            "A lot of women these days, a bit of a clown, avoid the subject matter. They concentrate on expressing their anger, their anger on the anger left over from real life.\n",

And then there are times where, but for the love of God, you actually get an opportunity because someone steps on your soil.

But you begin looking at the traditionalist perspective, when it is much more political and involved than it is intellectually.\n",
